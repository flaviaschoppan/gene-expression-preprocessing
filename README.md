# Gene Expression Preprocessing

This repository contains a methodological demonstration of common preprocessing operations applied to gene expression count matrices.

It illustrates how normalization, transformation, and basic quality inspection steps can be structured explicitly, with the goal of making numerical conditioning steps transparent and inspectable.

This project is not intended to define optimal preprocessing strategies, thresholds, or decision rules, nor to serve as a production-ready pipeline.  

It is maintained as a technical reference and is not under active development.
